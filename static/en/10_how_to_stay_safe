**Tochka Marketplace: User Safety and Best Practices**

**1. Maintaining Anonymity**

- **Separate Identities**: Avoid linking clearnet (regular web) sites with your Tor Browser to prevent association of your Tor connection with clearnet accounts.
- **Tor Browser Security**:
  - Disable JavaScript.
  - Keep software up-to-date for optimal security features.

**2. Secure Communication**

- **PGP Encryption**: Encrypt messages sent to vendors for enhanced security. Use PGP!

**3. Vendor Due Diligence**

- **Reputation Check**: Always verify vendors' reviews and ratings to minimize risk.
- **No Early Finalization**: Never release payment before receiving the product.
  - If a vendor pressures you to do so, report them to Tochka staff.
- **Dispute Resolution**:
  - If your order doesn't arrive within six days, initiate a dispute.

**4. Enhanced Security Measures**

- **Avoid Fake Identities**: Using real names minimizes attention and reduces the likelihood of scrutiny.
- **Drop Systems & P.O. Boxes**: Use intermediary addresses or P.O. boxes for package reception, employing forged documents if necessary.
- **Patience**: Anticipate delays due to weather conditions, holidays, and shipping processes.
- **Message Vendors First**: Attempt communication before leaving negative feedback; politeness can foster resolution.

**5. VPN Usage (Optional but Recommended)**

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) masks your IP address and location while encrypting online activity. Using a VPN alongside Tor enhances overall anonymity, protecting you from potential threats such as identity theft or hacking on public Wi-Fi networks.

Always remember: **Safety first, anonymity second**. Prioritize security measures before making purchases to ensure a safer, more private experience. Familiarize yourself with our Security Tutorials section for additional tips and best practices.
