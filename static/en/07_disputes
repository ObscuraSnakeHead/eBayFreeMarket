**Tochka Dispute Resolution Policy**

This policy governs dispute resolution for orders on Tochka Free Market, excluding those where vendors have established their own terms and conditions that do not violate market rules.

### **Dispute Individuality**

While we strive to maintain consistency in our dispute resolution process, each case is unique. We will assess disputes on an individual basis, tailoring our approach to the specifics of each situation.

### **Transparency in Decision-Making**

Tochka staff will discuss and explain any decision made regarding a dispute. If you feel aggrieved by our handling of your dispute, please communicate openly with us.

**Required Information for Dispute Resolution**

To facilitate swift resolution, please provide as much detail as possible when opening a dispute:

- Shipping origin and destination, along with estimated shipping time
- Communication logs or details received from the vendor

_Exclude:_

- Personal information such as shipping addresses or tracking numbers (these can be shared via PGP encryption if deemed necessary)
- Inappropriate language or behavior

**Estimated Shipping Times**

We adhere to the following estimated shipping times for dispute resolution:

- **Domestic**: 7 days after shipment
- **Europe to Europe/Continent-to-Neighboring Continent**: 14 days after shipment
