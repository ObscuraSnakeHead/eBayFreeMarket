# How to Buy on Darknet Markets

This guide will walk you through the process of purchasing items safely and securely on darknet markets (DNMs), using Tochka as an example.

## **Before You Start**

1. **Understand Risks**: Using DNMs involves inherent risks, such as law enforcement surveillance and potential vendor scams. Always exercise caution and good opsec practices.
2. **Install a Secure Browser**: Use Tor Browser to access onion sites securely and anonymously. Download it from the official website: <https://www.torproject.org/download/>
3. **Set Up a Wallet**: Create a wallet for your chosen cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin or Monero) to store funds for purchases.
4. **Create an Account**: Register on Tochka (or your preferred DNM) using your Tor Browser.

## **Searching and Selecting Products**

1. Navigate to the market's main page by entering its onion URL into the Tor Browser address bar.
2. Browse categories or use the search function to find products you're interested in.
3. Visit a vendor's storefront or product listing to learn more about their offerings, pricing, and policies.

## **Placing an Order**

1. Once you've found your desired item, click "Buy" or "Purchase" to add it to your cart.
2. Review your order details (quantity, price, fees) in your shopping cart.
3. Choose your preferred payment method:
   - **Escrow**: Most common; ensures both buyer and seller have protection until the product is delivered.
   - **Finalize Early (FE)**: Buyers pay upfront, sellers ship immediately. Riskier for buyers but offers faster delivery.
4. Select your desired package type (e.g., Mail, Digital, etc.) if applicable.
5. Click "Order Now" or similar button to proceed with the purchase.

## **Making Payment**

1. Follow the instructions provided on the checkout screen:
   - Generate a new Bitcoin/Moreno wallet address for each order.
   - Send the exact amount required (including fees) from your wallet to the generated address.
2. Wait for confirmations on the blockchain before continuing. This usually takes around 30 minutes but can vary.

## **Order Management**

1. Monitor your orders in your account's "Orders" page:
   - **PENDING**: Waiting for payment confirmation.
   - **COMPLETED**: Payment confirmed; awaiting vendor shipment.
   - **SHIPPED**: Vendor claims to have shipped the product.
   - **RECEIVED**: You've confirmed receipt of the product.
2. Communicate with vendors through the provided messaging system regarding order status, disputes, or requests.

## **Leaving Feedback and Reviews**

1. Once your order has reached "Received" status, you can leave feedback for the vendor:
   - Rate their service (e.g., 1-5 stars)
   - Write a review describing your experience
2. Other users will see this feedback when browsing that vendor's products.

## **Safety and Opsec Tips**

1. Always use Tor Browser to access DNMs.
2. Create and use new Bitcoin/Moreno addresses for each purchase.
3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your account whenever possible.
4. Never share personal information with vendors or other users.
5. Avoid purchasing large quantities of items at once to minimize risk.

By following this guide, you'll be able to safely and securely buy products on darknet markets like Tochka. Always remain cautious and prioritize opsec to protect your identity and funds.
